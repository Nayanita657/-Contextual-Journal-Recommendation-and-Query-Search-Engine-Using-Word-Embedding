# -Contextual-Journal-Recommendation-and-Query-Search-Engine-Using-Word-Embedding
â€”A large number of research articles are being published in conferences and journals. Most researchers identify their
related work by searching for keywords or reading only renowned
conferences and journal articles. Furthermore, researchers frequently fail to publish articles in appropriate journals due
to a lack of contextual understanding about publications. In
order to search the query in an article, it is also necessary
to comprehend the semantics of the text in unstructured data.
Natural language processing aids in the extraction of usable facts
from unstructured textual material. One approach to get around
this problem is to use word embedding. This article proposes a
Context-based Journal Recommendation system based on word
embedding and a Context-based Search Engine. The dataset
is self-contained, and the distance is calculated using cosine
similarity. The built system provides contextual functionality
that the existing entity-based journal recommender and search
engine do not. The proposed methodology will aid aspiring
researchers in determining which journal to submit their work
to for publication
